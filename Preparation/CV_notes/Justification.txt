1. What are distributed systems? 
------------------------------------

A distributed system is simply any environment where multiple computers or devices 
are working on a variety of tasks and components, all spread across a network. 
Components within distributed systems split up the work,
coordinating efforts to complete a given job more efficiently than if only a single device ran it.
Distributed systems are used when a workload is too great for a single computer or device to handle.

Common examples of distributed systems:
  - Airline and hotel reservation systems
  - Global, distributed retailers and supply chain management
  - Client-server systems
  
Key characteristics of a distributed system
 
 Scalability. 
    The ability to grow as the size of the workload increases is an essential feature of distributed systems, 
	accomplished by adding additional processing units or nodes to the network as needed. 
 Concurrency. 
    Distributed system components run simultaneously. 
 Availability and fault tolerance. 
    If one node fails, the remaining nodes can continue to operate without disrupting the overall computation.
	Distributed systems reduce the risks involved with having a single point of failure, 
	bolstering reliability and fault tolerance.
 Heterogeneity
 Replication
 Transparency. 
    The end user sees a distributed system as a single computational unit rather than as its underlying parts
 Reliability.
    A well-designed distributed system can withstand failures in one or more of its nodes 
	without severely impacting performance. 
	In a monolithic system, the entire application goes down if the server goes down.
 Speed. 
    Heavy traffic can bog down single servers when traffic gets heavy, 
	impacting performance for everyone. 
	The scalability of distributed databases and other distributed systems 
	makes them easier to maintain and also sustain high-performance levels.
 Geo-distribution. 
    Distributed content delivery is both intuitive for any internet user, and vital for global organizations.

Challenges: 

 1. Increased opportunities for failure.
      If a system is not carefully designed and a single node crashes, the entire system can go down. 
 2. Synchronization process challenges.
      Require careful programming to ensure that processes are properly synchronized 
	  to avoid transmission delays that result in errors and data corruption. 
	  In a complex system — such as a multiplayer video game — synchronization can be challenging, 
	  especially on a public network that carries data traffic.
 3. Imperfect scalability.
      Architecting an effective distributed system that maximizes scalability 
	  is a complex undertaking that needs to take into account load balancing, 
	  bandwidth management and other issues.
	  
	  Bandwidth management 
	    Is the process of measuring and controlling the communications (traffic, packets) on a network link, 
		to avoid filling the link to capacity or overfilling the link,
		[1] which would result in network congestion and poor performance of the network. 
	  
	  Network congestion. 
	    Is the reduced quality of service that occurs when a network node or link is carrying more data than it can handle. 
		Typical effects include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections

 4. More complex security
 5. Increased complexity. 
      Distributed systems are more complex to design, manage 
	  and understand than traditional computing environments.

Risks: 

 1. Security. 
   Distributed systems are as vulnerable to attack as any other system, 
   but their distributed nature creates a much larger attack surface 
   that exposes organizations to threats.

 2. Risk of network failure. 
   Distributed systems are beholden to public networks to transmit and receive data. 
   If one segment of the internet becomes unavailable or overloaded, distributed system performance may decline.

 3. Governance and control issues. 
   Distributed systems lack the governability of monolithic, single-server-based systems, 
   creating auditing and adherence issues around data privacy laws. 
   Globally distributed environments are challenging when it comes to providing certain 
   levels of assurance and understanding exactly where data resides.

 4. Cost control. 
   Unlike centralized systems, the scalability of distributed systems allows administrators
   to easily add additional capacity as needed, which can also increase costs. 
   Pricing for cloud-based distributed computing systems are based on usage 
   (such as the number of memory resources and CPU power consumed over time). 
   If demand suddenly spikes, you might face a massive bill.

1. Describe release processes. Release cycle 
     2 sprints of the release cycle
     each sprint is 2 weeks long
     end of sprint: 
	   - regression testing. e2e automated regression, manual regression
	   - system performance testing
	   - releases pushed to Staging, then to UAT for release rediness testing and once per month to Prod 
	   
 
Provide examples of those applications

SaaS   
-------------------------

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), is a cloud based software delivery model that allows 
end users to access software applications over the internet. 
With a SaaS model, the software is hosted on remote servers, 
maintained and updated by the service provider, and made available to customers via web browsers, mobile apps and APIs. 
SaaS provides a number of user benefits over traditional software delivery models, 
including reduced upfront costs, scalability, flexibility, and accessibility. 
As the software is hosted on the service provider's servers, 
there is no need for users to invest in expensive infrastructure in order to use the software. 
Instead, the end users pay a subscription fee to access the software as on-demand service.
