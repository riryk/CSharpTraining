2. Questions?
 - Do you provide opportunities for proffessional development?   
 - Have you ever had a project interview? 
 
 Last time I was interviewed on a project in English was 6 years ago. It was successful and I was taken on that project. I have been working on it since than and now I am being made redundant and looking for new opportunities. So, what I remembered most about those two interviews that they were conducted by very good managers. I was being asked questions about my previous experience and obstacles that I had encountered in the past and successfully overcome. I had made and examples and proved that I had solved these challenges successfully and has learn from it. 
 Apart from that, the developer manager asked me to write code online to check my problem-solving skills and asked a lot of follow-up questions. I answered everything, at least I thought so, and then he told me that he was going to interview other candidates and wished me good luck. 
 After this I did not even hope that there would take me on the positions, but 3 weeks later I was very surprised when I was informed that I had been finally offered this job.     

 The interviewer wanted to reduce the stress before the interview an talk a bit about something neutral. 
 Firstly, he asked about how things have been going and the interviewee did not bother to answer anything. 
 The interviewer could have just thought that Alex did not want to maintain the conversation and was not opened to talk. 
 He might have confirmed his assumption after asking his second question about the weather. 
 To me it looks like the interviewee failed to create a good first impression.

----------------------------------
1. Tell me about yourself?
----------------------------------

I am a senior software engineer mostly on back-end side using .NET technology stack 
I focus primarily on developing back-end side of applications. Recently, I have gained pretty good 
knowledge in desinging and developing microserves and deploying them to Cloud. 
Apart from that since I have been working for my customer since 2016 and I have managed to 
gain solid understanding of our application, last 1.5 years I have been mentoring and teaching 
our colleagues from India 

As for my experience, I have been working as an IT proffessional for more than 10 years. 
I started my career at 4rd year at my University. I was studing at Computational Math faculty. 
I came to Epam after having been working for 4 years on our Ukrainian companies. At Epam I have contributed 
to multiple projects mostly from US and Europe. My faivourite customers are the most recent ones: 
SNP and Wolters Kluter Twinfield. 

As far as I have already mentioned my expertise includes mostly back-end part of things. 
Databases, Web Api, Microservices. However, I am trying to deepen and broaden my knowlegde. 
I am learning Angular and recently have been participating in building UI componments and fixinf issues. 
For the last couple of years while working on SNP project I has a chance to gain pretty good 
knowledge in  migrating .NET Framework services from on-prem Windows boxes to AWS Clould 

Apart from that there have been a lot of communication within multi-cultural distributed teams recently.
Thus my communication skills should be pretty good I am comfortable working 
as part of multicultural distributed teams. 

I think that combination of my skills and experience will be a good fit for the position. 

--------------------------------------
2. What is your major achievement?
--------------------------------------

Technical IAN. OrderService

One of my major achivements so far is to build and release to production 
one of the central and most critical service from business perspective
It is the central service which allows BuySide investors and Sell side 
syndicate banks to exchange information electronically. BuySide could send orders 
and receive allocation. One of the most critical requirements was to provide 
guarranteed message delivery between these two sides. 

Releasing this service to Production was challenging because my team leader 
who had worked on this project as a key person together with me, he has left the 
project due to promotion to another role. Before that I had been working 
as a middle developer and become responsible for releasing this service to production 

After users started to use the apprication there were performance issues, 
some messages were lost, so I had to fix prod issues and made this service more reliable 
by breaking the full business flow onto small sub-systems and durable queues. 
In this was we isolated core business functionality from suplemental infrastructural part. 
Gurranteed deliery was achieved by sendinf ack messages back to IssueNet after saving updates. 
and by using internal queues. In case of an error, or external system being unavailable, 
messages were preserved in dead letter queues and were retried. Business flows were finished, 
event when IssueNet was down for 30 mins or when job workers stopped due to dead locks. 

As a result, reliability of the system was incresed. 

Technical IAN. Equity Book Build intergration using Event Sorcing CQRS, ServerLess. 

Leadership. Teaching indian colleagues.

------------------------------------------
3. Give me an example of a goal you met?
------------------------------------------
 Goal was to deliver Equity-OrderService in time whithin tight schedule 
 Goal was to Migrate our BuySide from on-prem Windows boxes to AWS cloud. 
 and teach 



The main idea here behind the STAR method is that every answer should cover the following topics:

(S) Situation - Describe the situation and the context in which the event took place.
(T) Task - Talk about the tasks you had to complete (i.e. your challenge or responsibility).
(A) Action - Explain the actions you took to address the above-mentioned challenges or responsibilities.
(R) Results - Explain the kind of results you achieved. When describing the outcome, 
              if possible, mention numbers and quantifiable facts. 
			  E.g. “Improved cold lead response time by 20%” VS “Improved sales.”










  - Tell me about yourself
