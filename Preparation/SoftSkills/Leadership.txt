1. The primary goal of leadership is to produce change and growth. 
The work of a leader is to envision a better tomorrow and design the change 
that will get the organization from here to there.

2. The primary goal of management is to produce order and consistency. 
The work of a manager is to create a stable work environment that's clear 
and consistent so that employees can be as productive as possible

3. Difference between managing and leading.

   1. The first distinction is about approach. Managing is tactical and hands-on, while leading is
      strategic and visionary. This is because the time frame is different.
   2. Managing occurs in the here and now. 
      You're looking at the short-term and mid-range goals 
	  that ensure success of the organization today. 
	  Contrast that with leading, where the focus in on 
	  the future and setting strategy and change to create the organization of tomorrow.
   3. Another difference is that the focus shifts. 
      For management, the focus is narrow and internal 
	  whereas the leader's view is broad and external, including other functions, industry, market, 
	  and national and global affairs.

 Adriana is managing when she runs department meetings discussing upcoming events. 
 She's leading when she identifies that many companies now have remote employees, 
 and she proposes new models for hosting conferences that'll allow for remote access.
 
   4. Managing relies on current resources and structures, 
      while leading designs new ones for the future.
   5. For managing the task goals are directing the daily work of employees to achieve
      currently identified goals, whereas leading requires planning for the future, 
	  setting a long-term vision and strategy to bring about the change.
   	  
 She's leading when she creates an innovative internship program 
 with a local culinary school to cultivate the best students as future employees and caterers.
  
   6. The people skills differ as well. Both managing and leading rely on emotional intelligence, 
      but managing is more tactical, like conducting one-on-one meetings, delegating tasks, 
	  and coaching employees to improve performance.
	   
	  Leading is about building the culture to maximize engagement, 
	  inspiring various stakeholders with a compelling vision, fostering collaboration, 
	  and cultivating the next generation of leaders. 
	  All of this is in service to achieving the future potential of the organization 
	  by maximizing the most important asset, its talented people.
   
   7. Adriana is managing when she delegates various events to her team, 
      rotating roles to build their skills. 
	  She's leading when she identifies some high potential employees 
	  and creates a cross functional team to assess industry trends and innovate new models.

To find a way to artfully navigate the inherent tensions and opportunities 
that live between the needs of your employees and the goals of your organization.

Understanding management styles:
  Task direction, 
  decision making,
  relationship building
  
Task direction 
  Is when the manager tells the employee what to do, as well as when, where, and how. 
  This may involve teaching and training as well as directives and instructions.

Decision making 
  Is the extent to which the manager involves employees in the decision making process.
  This exists on a continuum. 
  At one end, employees have no involvement at all,
  and at the other end the manager delegates decision making completely to the employees.
